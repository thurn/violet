# Ways to challenge players
- Box them in
- Split them up
- Show them one thing, give them another (illusions)
- Make them dig deep (drain only a certain type of resources)
- Set them up, knock them down (enemies with synergy, e.g. CON drain and something requiring a CON save)
- Hang them if they Can't Take a Joke (Creatures run away when threatened)
