# Decisions
 - ASCII-art graphics, very minimal
 - Nothing is procedurally generated or random
 - Ayanor worldship setting
 - Four gods (Aeris, Petra, Ignis, Aquis) represent the four types of magic
 - Two modes: narrative mode and combat mode, draw cards when you switch modes
 - Modes switch automatically if you see a hostile enemy, get attacked, or attack somebody
 - Mode switches back when no hostiles aware of your presence
 - Can't change equipment or deck in combat.
 - Can change both outside of combat
 - Items can be fixed-use or per-combat, but everything resets after combat is over.
 - Start generating mana at beginning of combat
 - Dice rolling is bag random but not normalized (deck of 40 cards marked 1-20).
 - Whenever possible, put mechanics on cards, not in rules
 - No races or classes, but "items" are actually cybernetic enhancements
 - No carry limits, can carry an arbitrary amount of stuff, can convert it to currency
 - No "planes", but teleportation and stuff is possible
 - Spells have subtypes, e.g. "fire", "mind control", "illusion"
 - "Detect magic" type spells figure out what's magic and what the subtype is.
 - No alignment, creatures, spells, some items associated with specific gods
