# Decisions
 - ASCII-art graphics, very minimal
 - Nothing is procedurally generated or random
 - Ayanor worldship setting
 - Four gods (Aeris, Petra, Ignis, Aquis) represent the four types of magic
 - Two modes: narrative mode and encounter mode, draw cards when you enter encounter mode
 - Modes switch automatically if you see a hostile enemy, get attacked, or attack somebody
 - Mode switches back when no hostiles aware of your presence
 - Can't change equipment or deck during encounter.
 - Can change both outside of encounter
 - Items can be fixed-use or per-combat, but everything resets after encounter is over.
 - Start generating mana at beginning of encounter
 - Rolling a d20 actually pulls a value from a deck of 30 cards numbered:
   [1,2,3,4,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,10,11,11,12,12,13,13,14,14,15,15,16,17,18,19,20]
 - Whenever possible, put mechanics on cards, not in rules
 - No races or classes, but "items" are actually cybernetic enhancements
 - No carry limits, can carry an arbitrary amount of stuff, can convert it to currency
 - No "planes", but teleportation and stuff is possible
 - Spells have subtypes, e.g. "fire", "mind control", "illusion"
   - Spells also require hands or verbal commands to execute
 - "Detect magic" type spells figure out what's magic and what the subtype is.
 - No alignment, creatures, spells, some items associated with specific gods
 - You can "lock" cards. Your starting hand at beginning of encounter mode depends on locks:
   - 3 locked cards
   - 2 locked cards, 2 random cards
   - 1 locked card, 4 random cards
   - 0 locked cards, 6 random cards
 - Maximum hand size is 6, draw 1 at beginning of turn, discard down to 6 at end of turn
 - At beginning of encounter, there is a "reaction round" where both sides can take reactions
 - Whichever side has the element of surprise goes first in the reaction round and subsequent rounds
 - "Saving throws" are just normal skill or attribute checks to mitigate some effects
 - Three attributes:
   - Mind (intellect, charisma, wisdom, cunning, presence, knowledge)
   - Fortitude (strength, constitution, brawn, might)
   - Agility (dexterity, speed)
 - Fortitude governs base HP
 - Agility governs aim
 - Six skills: Athletics, Acrobatics, Mechanics, Perception, Stealth, Influence
 - Attribute check is "roll lower than attribute score with modifiers"
 - Skills just add modifiers to certain attribute checks
 - Checks can have various circumstantial bonuses, e.g. assistance from others
 - Up to 10 levels in each skill
 - Each level gives you a +1 bonus to checks of that type
 - On level up, get 4 skill points, 1 attribute point, extra health
 - Level up 10 times
 - Quantities that can be damaged:
  - health
  - ability scores
  - max health
  - max mana
  - movement speed
  - skills (avoid)
- "Caster level bonus" can be represented via bonus mana which you can use for a specific purpose
- Spells can be illusions or mind-affecting, it's a Mind attribute save to resist
