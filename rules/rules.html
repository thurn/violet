    <b>Spellseeker</b> is a turn-based, squad-oriented tactical combat system
    set in a fantasy-modern world. The player battles mythical creatures and
    ferocious monsters, employing conventional weapons and incredible magical
    spells based on a collectible card system.
  </p>

  <h1>Gameplay Overview</h1>

  <p>
    Gameplay is turn-oriented. The player controls a squad of warriors
    individually referred to as <b>units</b>. A turn consists of the
    <b>beginning of turn</b> step, followed by each unit a player controls
    making a <b>move</b> (paid for with <i class="move"></i> movement points)
    and then taking an <b>action</b> (represented by the <i class="action"></i>
    symbol), finally followed by the <b>end-of-turn</b> step.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the most important game actions is casting spells. Spells are cards
    that the player plays from their <b>spell deck</b>, a deck of at least 50
    cards constructed before the game begins. Spells can be cast at any time on
    a player's turn or in certain other circumstances. See <a
    href="#-spellcasting"> Spellcasting</a> for more information.
  </p>

  <h2>Beginning of Turn Step</h2>
  <p>
      At the beginning of a player's turn, the player draws a card. Next, each
      unit the player controls gains 1 <b>mana</b> (<i
      class="m1"></i>). Finally, one <i class="time"></i> (time marker) is
      removed from each card in play with one or more <i class="time"></i> on
      it.
  </p>

  <h2>Movement and Distance</h2>
  <p>
      All units have a movement speed. When a unit takes a turn, it gains <i
      class="move"></i> (movement points) equal to its movement speed. Units can
      move a number of squares by spending an equal number of movement points,
      but moves must be continuous (it's not possible to partially move and
      then decide to move further or to abort the movement halfway
      through). Units cannot move into blocked squares.
  </p>
  <p>
      Some actions, such as attacking with certain weapons, have a <b>speed
      penalty</b> associated with them. Because these actions take longer than
      normal actions, movement points must be spent to complete the action.
  </p>
  <p>
      <a href="#-line-of-sight">Line of Sight</a> is checked for each square
      during movement, and entering the line of sight of an enemy who has taken
      the <a href="#-hold-action">Hold action</a> can immediately provoke a
      <a href="#-reactions-and-the-stack">Reaction</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
      Distance is calculated by counting the squares on the path between the
      origin and destination. Diagonals are counted in alternating fashion, such
      that the first diagonal move counts as one square and the second counts as
      two. The diagrams below illustrate the distance between the A square and
      various other squares.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img class="imageBlock" src="distance.png" />
  </p>

  <h2>Actions</h2>
  <p>
      After the beginning-of-turn step and making a move, the unit gets one <i
      class="action"></i> to spend on an action, either one of the standard
      actions below or to pay for a spell or card activation with "<i
      class="action"></i>" in the cost.
  </p>

  <h3>Sprint Action</h3>
  <p>
      The unit gains <i class="move"></i> equal to its movement speed and can
      make a second movement in addition to its normal movement for the turn.
  </p>

  <h3>Attack Action</h3>
  <p>
      The unit uses its equipped weapon to attack an enemy in range, dealing
      damage if a hit is scored. See <a href="#-combat">Combat</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Reload Action</h3>
  <p>
      The unit reloads their equipped weapon. Weapons must be reloaded
      occasionally to ensure that they don't run out of ammunition. See
      <a href="#-guns">Guns</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Hold Action</h3>
  <p>
      The unit stays on watch, prepared to respond to enemy activity. It may get
      an opportunity for a reaction to enemy activity. See <a
      href="#-reactions-and-the-stack">Reactions</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>End of Turn Step</h2>
  <p>
      After all units have finished taking actions and moving, the end of turn
      step begins. Unspent <i class="action"></i> and <i class="move"></i> are
      lost. If the player has more than 5 cards in hand, they discard down to 5
      cards.
  </p>

  <h1>Attributes</h1>
  <p>
      All units in Spellseeker have 3 common attribute scores which describe
      their ability to perform various game actions. These attributes are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Agility</b>, which captures the unit's reflexes and
          dexterity. Units with a higher agility have better aim.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Fortitude</b>, which captures the unit's constitution and
          strength. Units with a higher constitution have more health.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Awareness</b>, which captures the unit's intelligence and
          willpower. Units with a higher awareness are more resistant to certain
          types of mental attacks and illusions.
        </li>
      </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Attribute Checks</h2>
  <p>
      Many game situations call for an <b>attribute check</b> to resolve the
      outcome of a particular action. In order to make an attribute check, start
      with the unit's attribute score and add any bonuses or penalties to the
      score as appropriate to get an <b>attribute target</b>. Finally, roll a
      20-sided die. If the number rolled is <b>lower than or equal to</b> the
      attribute target, the result of check was success. A typical attribute
      score for a unit is a value in the 12 to 14 range.
  </p>
  <p>
      For example, a unit attacking might have an Agility of 13 and may have a
      +2 bonus to the attack. Adding in the bonus means the agility target is
      15, so the unit must roll 15 or less to score a hit.
  </p>


  <h1>Cards</h1>
  <p>
      Cards in Spellseeker are the basis of the game. They are the reward for
      successful adventuring -- killing enemies results in new cards for the
      player to add to their spell deck. There are various card types present in
      the game:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Action</b> cards describe the basic actions in the game. They serve
          as reminders of the possible actions which can be taken after a move,
          and cannot be discarded or interacted with in any other way.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Spell</b> cards can be cast by the player by paying the
          appropriate costs during their turn, or at certain other times (See <a
          href="#-spellcasting">Spellcasting</a> for more information). Spells
          have two possible subtypes:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Immediate</b> spells are one-time effects. The caster pays
              their costs, the effects resolve, and then the card is discarded.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Ongoing</b> spells stay in play after being resolved,
              continuing to have an impact, instead of being discarded.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Equipment</b> cards represent tools used the units which give them
          special abilities and ongoing effects. See <a href="#-equipment">
          Equipment</a> for more information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Enemy</b> cards represent the various foes the player can encounter
          during the game, describing their abilities and basic statistics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Spellseeker</b> cards represent the different units controlled by
          the player, and also display their basic statistics such as movement
          speed.
        </li>
      </ul>
  </p>

  <h1>Reactions and the Stack</h1>
  <p>
  When a unit casts a spell, activates an activated effect, makes an attack, or
  moves within the sight of an enemy for the first time on a turn, the effect
  does not resolve immediately. Instead, the effect is put into an ephemeral
  area called <b>the stack</b> to allow enemy units to respond. The unit
  creating the initial effect is called the <b>initator</b>, and if an enemy
  responds, the initiator is said to have <b>provoked </b> a <b>reaction</b>.
  </p>
  Any enemy units which have taken the <a href="#-hold-action">Hold</a> action
  within sight of the initiator get an opportunity to react first.  They can
  cast any number of spells, activate any number of activated effects, or Attack
  the initiator. A unit can make a maximum of one Attack per Hold action, and
  the attack must be made as a reaction. These actions do not happen
  immediately, but are also put onto the stack for later resolution.
  </p>
  <p>
  After the Holding units are finished taking actions, <b>priority</b> is passed
  to the opposing side. Units on this side which a are within sight of the
  initiator, including the initiator, can cast any number of spells and activate
  any number of activated effects, but they <u>cannot</u> Attack.
  </p>
  <p>
  After these units have finished, priority is again passed, and the process
  repeats, with the Holding units again able to react. Priority continues
  passing in this manner between both sides until one side passes. At that
  point, all the effects on the stack are resolved in reverse order, starting
  with the most recently added, until finally the initiating effect is allowed
  to continue.
  </p>

  <h1>Combat</h1>
  <p>
      Combat takes place on a standard grid (potentially three-dimensional), and
      primarily involves resolving attacks. There are five steps involved in
      making an attack: checking line of sight, checking range, checking cover,
      rolling for a hit, and rolling for damage.
  </p>

  <h2>Line of Sight</h2>
  <p>
      A unit can only attack or cast a spell which targets an enemy if it has
      line of sight from its current square to a square containing that
      enemy. Similarly, area attacks and area attack spells require line of
      sight to the target square of the attack.
  </p>
  <p>
      Line of sight exists if a line can be drawn from one of the closest
      corners of the square containing the attacker to one of the closest
      corners of the square containing the defender without running through a
      full cover square (partial cover never obstructs line of sight). Running
      along the edge or through the corner of a full cover square is not enough
      to obstruct line of sight, the line must intersect the interior of the
      barrier.
  </p>
  <p>
      In the examples below, orange squares represent full cover barriers. White
      squares are ones where the units at A and B respectively have line of
      sight, and grey squares are ones where they do not have line of sight.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="imageBlock" src="lineOfSight.png" />
  </p>

  <h2>Cover</h2>
  <p>
      Various pieces of the environment can provide cover to make units harder
      to hit. There are two types of cover, called <b>partial cover</b> and
      <b>full cover</b>, which grant different levels of protection. A unit is
      in cover if a line drawn from an attacker-chosen corner of the attacker's
      square to a defender-chosen corner of the defender's square intersects the
      interior of an obstacle, with the type of cover depending on the type of
      the obstacle. Unlike line of sight, cover is not symmetrical. Below, light
      blue squares have full cover from the unit at A in the first example and
      from the unit at B in the second example. Note that A has full cover from
      B, but not vice versa.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="imageBlock" src="cover.png" />
  </p>
  <p>
      Attacks against a unit in full cover are made at a <b>-8 penalty</b> to
      hit. Attacks against a unit in partial cover are made at a <b>-4
      penalty</b> to hit. Some attacks, called <b>area attacks</b>, ignore
      cover.
  </p>

  <h2>Range</h2>
  <p>
      Weapons and spells have a <b>maximum range</b> of 16 squares, beyond which
      they cannot hit. They can also have a <b>short range multiplier</b> or a
      <b>long range multiplier</b> which impact their accuracy at various
      distances. All weapons have the same accuracy at a distance of 8 squares.
      Shots closer than that are called "short range" and shots further away
      than that are called "long range".
  </p>
  <p>
      To find the range bonus or penalty for a shot, multiply the range
      multiplier by the absolute distance away from 8 squares. For example, if
      a weapon has a "1x short range" multiplier and a shot is being taken from
      2 squares away from the target, the aim bonus is +6. Range penalties also
      exist. For example, a "-2x long range" multiplier imposes a penalty on
      long range shots. A shot taken from 10 squares away with such a weapon
      would have a -4 penalty to aim.
  </p>
  <p>
      <a href="#-appendix-a-common-range-modifiers">Appendix A</a> contains a
      complete range bonus and penalty table for several common weapon types.
  </p>

  <h2>Hits and Damage</h2>
  <p>
      To determine if an attack is a hit, the attacker makes a standard <a
      href="#-attribute-checks">agility attribute check</a>, applying the
      various modifiers as appropriate. On success, the attack is a hit. The
      most common modifiers that affect attack accuracy are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Range, with the specific modifier depending on the weapon, see
          <a href="#-range">Range</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover, -4 penalty if the target has partial cover and -8 if the target
          is in full cover, see <a href="#-cover">Cover</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the attack is a <a href="#-reactions-and-the-stack">reaction
          attack</a>, the attacker takes a -4 penalty to hit.
        </li>
      </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
      Area attacks do not need to roll for hits: they always hit if they are
      within 16 squares and have line of sight to the target.
  </p>
  <p>
      The effect of a hit being scored depends on the type of attack. For basic
      weapons, the weapon damage will be specified in terms of <b>damage
      dice</b> to roll to calculate damage.
  </p>
  <p>
      <a href="#-appendix-b-expected-damage">Appendix B</a> contains a table of
      the expected damage output for an attack with various hit modifiers and
      damage dice.
  </p>

  <h2>Health, Unconsciousness, and Death</h2>
  <p>
  Units have a base number of <b>health points</b> equal to their fortitude
  attribute, which represents the amount of damage they can sustain before
  falling <b>unconscious</b>. Health can be increased by certain spells and
  equipment. When a unit falls unconscious, it remains at 0 health and cannot
  sustain further damage or take any actions. Each turn, the unit has a risk of
  permanently <b>dying</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Instead of taking normal moves and actions, an unconscious unit makes a <a
  href="#-attribute-checks">Fortitude check</a> each turn. The check is
  initially made at +5 bonus, but this modifier decreases by 1 for each
  additional turn the unit remains unconscious and can eventually become
  negative. If the check fails, the unit dies permanently. If the unit is healed
  above 0 health, it stops needing to make these checks and can once again
  function normally.
