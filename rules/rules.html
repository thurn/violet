    <b>Spellseeker</b> is a turn-based, squad-oriented tactical combat system
    set in a fantasy-modern world. The player battles mythical creatures and
    ferocious monsters, employing conventional weapons and incredible magical
    spells based on a collectible card system.
  </p>

  <h1>Gameplay Overview</h1>

  <p>
    Gameplay is turn-oriented. The player controls a team of warriors
    individually referred to as <b>units</b>. A turn consists of the
    <b>beginning of turn</b> step, followed by each unit a player controls
    making a <b>move</b> (paid for with <i class="move"></i> movement points)
    and then taking an <b>action</b> (represented by the <i class="action"></i>
    symbol), finally followed by the <b>end-of-turn</b> step. While it is their
    turn, units are said to be on the <b>active team</b>, and their enemies are
    said to be on the <b>inactive team</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the most important game actions is casting spells. Spells are cards
    that the player plays from their <b>spell deck</b>, a deck of at least 50
    cards constructed before the game begins. Spells can be cast at any time on
    a player's turn or in certain other circumstances. See <a
    href="#-spellcasting"> Spellcasting</a> for more information.
  </p>

  <h2>Beginning of Turn Step</h2>
  <p>
      At the beginning of the player's turn, the player draws a card. Next, each
      unit the player controls gains 1 <b>mana</b> (<i
      class="m1"></i>). Finally, one <i class="time"></i> (time marker) is
      removed from each card in play with one or more <i class="time"></i> on
      it.
  </p>

  <h2>Movement and Distance</h2>
  <p>
      When a unit takes a turn, it gains <i class="move"></i> (movement points)
      equal to its <b>movement speed</b> (half its <a
      href="#-attributes">Agility attribute</a>, rounded down). Units can move a
      number of squares by spending an equal number of movement points, but
      moves must be continuous (it's not possible to partially move and then
      decide to move further or to abort the movement halfway through). Units
      cannot move into blocked squares.
  </p>
  <p>
      Some actions, such as attacking with certain weapons, have a <b>speed
      penalty</b> associated with them. Because these actions take longer than
      normal actions, movement points must be spent to complete the action.
  </p>
  <p>
      <a href="#-line-of-sight">Line of Sight</a> is checked for each square
      during movement, and entering the line of sight of an enemy who has taken
      the <a href="#-hold-action">Hold action</a> can immediately provoke a
      <a href="#-reactions-and-the-stack">Reaction</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
      Distance is calculated by counting the squares on the path between the
      origin and destination. Diagonals are counted in alternating fashion, such
      that the first diagonal move counts as one square and the second counts as
      two. The diagrams below illustrate the distance between the A square and
      various other squares.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img class="imageBlock" src="distance.png" />
  </p>

  <h2>Actions</h2>
  <p>
      After the beginning-of-turn step and making a move, the unit gets one <i
      class="action"></i> to spend on an action, either one of the standard
      actions below or to pay for a spell or card activation with "<i
      class="action"></i>" in the cost.
  </p>

  <h3>Sprint Action</h3>
  <p>
      The unit gains <i class="move"></i> equal to its movement speed and can
      make a second movement in addition to its normal movement for the turn.
  </p>

  <h3>Attack Action</h3>
  <p>
      The unit uses its equipped weapon to attack an enemy in range, dealing
      damage if a hit is scored. See <a href="#-combat">Combat</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Reload Action</h3>
  <p>
      The unit reloads their equipped weapon. Weapons must be reloaded
      occasionally to ensure that they don't run out of ammunition. See
      <a href="#-weapon-subtypes">Weapon Subtypes</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Hold Action</h3>
  <p>
      The unit stays on watch, prepared to respond to enemy activity. It may get
      an opportunity for a reaction to enemy activity. See <a
      href="#-reactions-and-the-stack">Reactions</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>End of Turn Step</h2>
  <p>
      After all units have finished taking actions and moving, the end of turn
      step begins. Unspent <i class="action"></i> and <i class="move"></i> are
      lost. If the player has more than 5 cards in hand, they discard down to 5
      cards.
  </p>

  <h1>Attributes</h1>
  <p>
      All units in Spellseeker have 3 common attribute scores which describe
      their ability to perform various game actions. These attributes are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Agility</b>, which captures the unit's reflexes and
          dexterity. Units with a higher agility have better aim.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Fortitude</b>, which captures the unit's constitution and
          strength. Units with a higher constitution have more health.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Awareness</b>, which captures the unit's intelligence and
          willpower. Units with a higher awareness are more resistant to certain
          types of mental attacks and illusions.
        </li>
      </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Attribute Checks</h2>
  <p>
      Many game situations call for an <b>attribute check</b> to resolve the
      outcome of a particular action. In order to make an attribute check, start
      with the unit's attribute score and add any bonuses or penalties to the
      score as appropriate to get an <b>attribute target</b>. Finally, roll a
      20-sided die. If the number rolled is <b>lower than or equal to</b> the
      attribute target, the result of check was success. A typical attribute
      score for a unit is a value in the 12 to 14 range.
  </p>
  <p>
      For example, a unit attacking might have an Agility of 13 and may have a
      +2 bonus to the attack. Adding in the bonus means the agility target is
      15, so the unit must roll 15 or less to score a hit.
  </p>


  <h1>Cards</h1>
  <p>
      Cards in Spellseeker are the basis of the game. They are the reward for
      successful adventuring -- killing enemies results in new cards for the
      player to add to their spell deck. There are various card types present in
      the game:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Action</b> cards describe the basic actions in the game. They serve
          as reminders of the possible actions which can be taken after a move,
          and cannot be discarded or interacted with in any other way.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Spell</b> cards can be cast by the player by paying the
          appropriate costs during their turn, or at certain other times (See <a
          href="#-spellcasting">Spellcasting</a> for more information). Spells
          have two possible subtypes:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Immediate</b> spells are one-time effects. The caster pays
              their costs, the effects resolve, and then the card is discarded.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Ongoing</b> spells stay in play after being resolved,
              continuing to have an impact, instead of being discarded.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Attack</b> spells require the caster to <a
              href="#-hits-and-damage">roll to hit</a> the target before their
              effects resolve. The attack is always made at a <a href="#-range">
              1x short range</a> bonus to hit. On a miss, the spell has no
              effect.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Temporary</b> spells enter play with a number of markers on
              them, and then stay in play until the last marker is removed.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Equipment</b> cards represent tools used the units which give them
          special abilities and ongoing effects. See <a href="#-equipment">
          Equipment</a> for more information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Enemy</b> cards represent the various foes the player can encounter
          during the game, describing their abilities and basic statistics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Spellseeker</b> cards represent the different units controlled by
          the player, and also display their basic statistics such as movement
          speed.
        </li>
      </ul>
  </p>

  <h1>Reactions and the Stack</h1>
  <p>
  When a unit casts a spell, activates an activated effect, makes an attack, or
  moves within the sight of an enemy for the first time on a turn, the effect
  does not resolve immediately. Instead, the effect is put into an ephemeral
  area called <b>the stack</b> to allow enemy units to respond. The unit
  creating the initial effect is called the <b>initator</b>, and if an enemy
  responds, the initiator is said to have <b>provoked </b> a <b>reaction</b>.
  </p>
  Any enemy units which have taken the <a href="#-hold-action">Hold</a> action
  within sight of the initiator (on the inactive team) get an opportunity to
  react first.  They can cast any number of spells, activate any number of
  activated effects, or Attack the initiator. A unit can make a maximum of one
  Attack per Hold action, and the attack must be made as a reaction. These
  actions do not happen immediately, but are also put onto the stack for later
  resolution.
  </p>
  <p>
  After the Holding units are finished taking actions, <b>priority</b> is passed
  to the active team. Units on this team which are within sight of the
  initiator, including the initiator, can cast any number of spells and activate
  any number of activated effects, but they <u>cannot</u> Attack.
  </p>
  <p>
  After these units have finished, priority is again passed back to the inactive
  team, and the process repeats, with the Holding units on the inactive team
  again able to react. Priority continues passing in this manner between both
  teams until one team passes. At that point, all the effects on the stack are
  resolved in reverse order, starting with the most recently added, until
  finally the initiating effect is allowed to continue.
  </p>

  <h1>Combat</h1>
  <p>
      Combat takes place on a standard grid (potentially three-dimensional), and
      primarily involves resolving attacks. There are five steps involved in
      making an attack: checking line of sight, checking range, checking cover,
      rolling for a hit, and rolling for damage.
  </p>

  <h2>Line of Sight</h2>
  <p>
      A unit can only attack or cast a spell which targets an enemy if it has
      line of sight from its current square to a square containing that
      enemy. Similarly, area attacks and area attack spells require line of
      sight to the target square of the attack.
  </p>
  <p>
      Line of sight exists if a line can be drawn from one of the closest
      corners of the square containing the attacker to one of the closest
      corners of the square containing the defender without running through a
      full cover square (partial cover never obstructs line of sight). Running
      along the edge or through the corner of a full cover square is not enough
      to obstruct line of sight, the line must intersect the interior of the
      barrier.
  </p>
  <p>
      In the examples below, orange squares represent full cover barriers. White
      squares are ones where the units at A and B respectively have line of
      sight, and grey squares are ones where they do not have line of sight.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="imageBlock" src="lineOfSight.png" />
  </p>

  <h2>Cover</h2>
  <p>
      Various pieces of the environment can provide cover to make units harder
      to hit. There are two types of cover, called <b>partial cover</b> and
      <b>full cover</b>, which grant different levels of protection. A unit is
      in cover if a line drawn from an attacker-chosen corner of the attacker's
      square to a defender-chosen corner of the defender's square intersects the
      interior of an obstacle, with the type of cover depending on the type of
      the obstacle. Unlike line of sight, cover is not symmetrical. Below, light
      blue squares have full cover from the unit at A in the first example and
      from the unit at B in the second example. Note that A has full cover from
      B, but not vice versa.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="imageBlock" src="cover.png" />
  </p>
  <p>
      Attacks against a unit in full cover are made at a <b>-8 penalty</b> to
      hit. Attacks against a unit in partial cover are made at a <b>-4
      penalty</b> to hit. Some attacks, called <b>area attacks</b>, ignore
      cover.
  </p>

  <h2>Range</h2>
  <p>
      Weapons and spells have a <b>maximum range</b> of 16 squares, beyond which
      they cannot hit. They can also have a <b>short range multiplier</b> or a
      <b>long range multiplier</b> which impact their accuracy at various
      distances. All weapons have the same accuracy at a distance of 8 squares.
      Shots closer than that are called "short range" and shots further away
      than that are called "long range".
  </p>
  <p>
      To find the range bonus or penalty for a shot, multiply the range
      multiplier by the absolute distance away from 8 squares. For example, if
      a weapon has a "1x short range" multiplier and a shot is being taken from
      2 squares away from the target, the aim bonus is +6. Range penalties also
      exist. For example, a "-2x long range" multiplier imposes a penalty on
      long range shots. A shot taken from 10 squares away with such a weapon
      would have a -4 penalty to aim.
  </p>
  <p>
      <a href="#-appendix-a-common-range-modifiers">Appendix A</a> contains a
      complete range bonus and penalty table for several common weapon types.
  </p>

  <h2>Hits and Damage</h2>
  <p>
      To determine if an attack is a hit, the attacker makes a standard <a
      href="#-attribute-checks">agility attribute check</a>, applying the
      various modifiers as appropriate. On success, the attack is a hit. The
      most common modifiers that affect attack accuracy are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Range, with the specific modifier depending on the weapon, see
          <a href="#-range">Range</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover, -4 penalty if the target has partial cover and -8 if the target
          is in full cover, see <a href="#-cover">Cover</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the attack is a <a href="#-reactions-and-the-stack">reaction
          attack</a>, the attacker takes a -4 penalty to hit.
        </li>
      </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
      Area attacks do not need to roll for hits: they always hit if they are
      within 16 squares and have line of sight to the target.
  </p>
  <p>
      The effect of a hit being scored depends on the type of attack. For basic
      weapons, the weapon damage will be specified in terms of <b>damage
      dice</b> to roll to calculate damage.
  </p>
  <p>
      <a href="#-appendix-b-expected-damage">Appendix B</a> contains a table of
      the expected damage output for an attack with various hit modifiers and
      damage dice.
  </p>

  <h2>Health, Unconsciousness, and Death</h2>
  <p>
  Units have a base number of <b>health points</b> equal to their fortitude
  attribute, which represents the amount of damage they can sustain before
  falling <b>unconscious</b>. Health can be increased by certain spells and
  equipment. When a unit falls unconscious, it remains at 0 health and cannot
  sustain further damage or take any actions. Each turn, the unit has a risk of
  permanently <b>dying</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Instead of taking normal moves and actions, an unconscious unit makes a <a
  href="#-attribute-checks">Fortitude check</a> each turn. The check is
  initially made at +5 bonus, but this modifier decreases by 1 for each
  additional turn the unit remains unconscious and can eventually become
  negative. If the check fails, the unit dies permanently. If the unit is healed
  above 0 health, it stops needing to make these checks and can once again
  function normally.
  </p>

  <h1>Spellcasting</h1>
  <p>
  Spells in Spellseeker are represented by spell cards. Each spell card belongs
  to one of the four <b>schools</b> of magic: air, fire, water, or earth. Each
  unit must select one of the four schools to specialize in and can <u>only</u>
  cast spells from their chosen school.
  </p>
  <p>
  All spell cards also have a <b>cost</b> printed on them, which must be paid
  before the spell can be played. The most common type of cost is a <b>mana
  cost</b>. In order to cast such a spell, the unit must spend mana equal to the
  cost from its <b>mana pool</b>. Units add 1 mana to their pool during the
  <a href="#-beginning-of-turn-step">beginning of turn step</a> and can have a
  maximum of 10 mana stored.
  </p>

  <h2>Spell Decks</h2>
  <p>
  Spells are drawn from a Spell Deck which is constructed before the game
  begins. The spell deck consists of 40 cards and cannot contain more than 4
  copies of the same card. The player begins with no cards in hand, and draws a
  new spell card during the <a href="#-beginning-of-turn-step">beginning of turn
  step</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  If the spell deck is empty, no further spell cards can be drawn, but the game
  continues as normal. During the <a href="#-end-of-turn-step">end of turn
  step</a>, if the player has more than 5 cards in hand, they discard down to a
  maximum of 5 cards.
  </p>
  <p>
  Enemies of the player cast spells using spell cards as well, but do not
  have a spell deck. Enemies simply have a fixed starting hand of spell cards
  and do not draw additional cards. Enemies do have mana pools which refill over
  time, sometimes at a rate other than 1 mana per turn.
  </p>

  <h2>Spell Timing</h2>
  <p>
  Spells can be cast by a unit at any time while its team is active. They can
  also be cast as a reaction during the enemy turn if the unit takes the Hold
  action (see <a href="#-reactions-and-the-stack">Reactions and the
  Stack</a>). Spells with <i class="action"></i> or <i class="move"></i> in their
  costs require the unit to spend its action for the turn or some of its
  movement points for the turn respectively to cast the spell, and cannot be cast
  as a reaction.
  </p>

  <h2>Effect Resolution</h2>
  <p>
  Casting a spell or activating an activated effect follows a sequence of steps:
  <ol>
    <li>
      The player announced which unit is casting the spell or activating the
      activated effect and the name of the effect, revealing the card if
      necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the spell offers a choice of multiple different effects, they announce
      which effect or effects will be used.
    </li>
    <li>
      The player pays any costs required. If they wish to add any optional
      effects (see <a href="#-reading-a-spell-card">Reading a Spell Card</a>),
      they announce which ones at this time and pay any costs associated with
      them as well.
    </li>
    <li>
      The player selects a target for the spell which meets the spell's
      targeting requirements, if any.
    </li>
    <li>
      The effect is put onto the <a href="#-reactions-and-the-stack">stack</a>
      to be eventually resolved.
    </li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
  After the stack is resolved, the text instructions on the spell card are
  followed in the order in which they are printed. Choices like targeting are
  again checked for legality, and instructions on a spell card which attempt to
  interact with no-longer-legal targets do not resolve.
  </p>

  <p>
  If two effects are created simultaneously, effects created by the active team
  go on the stack first in <b>timestamp order</b>, meaning that effects created
  by spell cards played earlier go onto the stack first. Effects created by the
  inactive team are then added to the stack in the same order.
  </p>

  <h2>Reading a Spell Card</h2>
  <p>
  All spell cards have several common components. The top of the card shows
  the cost of the spell. Costs can be in terms of mana, but can also require
  spending <i class="action"></i> (actions) or <i class="move"></i> (movement
  points), or even things like discarding a card. A cost symbol like <i
  class="time"></i> means that the indicated number of time markers should be
  put on the card. Similarly, a <i class="charge"></i> symbol means to put a
  number of charge markers onto the card.
  </p>
  <p>
  Some spells have <b>optional effects</b>, which are written in the form Cost:
  Effect. These are effects that can be added (one time) to the spell's
  text. Optional effects are selected before the spell is put onto the
  stack. Optional effects can also be written in the form Condition: Effect,
  which creates the stated effect automatically if the condition is true when
  the spell is cast.
  </p>
  <p>
  Spells can also have <b>activated effects</b>, which are written in the form
  Cost <i class="doubleArrow"></i> Effect. After such a spell has resolved, the
  activated effect can be created at will as many times as is desired, as long
  as the cost is paid. Activated effects use the stack like regular spells and
  can be reacted to. Activated effects of cards with <i class="time"></i> (time
  markers) on them cannot be activated.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="imageBlock" src="templating.png" />
  </p>

  <h1>Equipment</h1>
  <p>
  Equipment represents the weapons, armor, and other tools that units bring
  with them into combat. Equipment cards are received as a reward for combat
  success much in the same way as spell cards, but equipment belongs to a
  specific unit and cannot be changed during gameplay, only configured outside
  of an individual encounter. Units are limited to at most one piece of
  equipment with a given equipment type.
  </p>
  <h2>Equipment Types</h2>
  <p>
  The following equipment types are available in Spellseeker:
  <ul>
    <li>Weapon</li>
    <li>Armor</li>
    <li>Face (goggles, lenses, masks, spectacles)</li>
    <li>Feet (boots, sandals, shoes, slippers)</li>
    <li>Head (circlets, crowns, hats, helmets)</li>
    <li>Fingers (rings)</li>
    <li>Hands (gauntlet, gloves)</li>
    <li>Throat (Amulets, brooches, collars, medals, necklaces, pedants)</li>
    <li>Wasit (belts, girdles, sashes)</li>
    <li>Miscellaneous</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Weapon Subtypes</h2>
  <p>
  Within the category of weapons, different subtypes are available. The subtype
  of a weapon indicates its general characteristics, but the specific details
  vary substantially. The following table compares typical values for the weapon
  subtypes:
  </p>
  <p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Weapon</th>
        <th>Magazine Capacity</th>
        <th>Range Bonus/Penalty</th>
        <th>Standard Damage</th>
        <th>Speed Penalty</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Pistol</td>
        <td>Unlimited</td>
