    <b>Spellseeker</b> is a turn-based, squad-oriented tactical combat system
    set in a fantasy-modern world. The player battles mythical creatures and
    ferocious monsters, employing conventional weapons and incredible magical
    spells based on a collectible card system.
  </p>

  <h1>Backstory</h1>
  <p>
  In the year 3164 AD, the Worldship <i>Ayanor</i> departed from Earth with a
  million passengers on board. The first ship of its class, the Ayanor was
  comissioned to lead humanity out into deep space for the first time. It was to
  travel to a nearby star system called Gliese 667 and establish a colony on an
  Earth-like planet there.
  </p>
  <p>
  The novel new propulsion system designed for the ship, employing the latest
  breakthroughs in physics, enabled it to steadily accelerate over a period of
  many years to reach a maximum flight velocity of almost 5000 kilometers per
  second. Even at this incredible pace, however, Ayanor's trip would take nearly
  two millenia: a journey of a hundred generations.
  </p>
  <p>
  In order to manage the ship's systems, four state-of-the art AIs were
  installed and designed to coordinate the engines, living environments, and
  advanced onboard nanotechnology. These AIs were based on a recently developed
  technique called "mind inflation". Each one was the result of scanning the
  mind of volunteer at an incredible level of detail and mapping it into a
  computer simulation.
  </p>
  <p>
  Although the early trials had been successful, the mind inflation process
  proved to be fatally flawed. Transported into a truly alien body, the
  volunteer's minds were unable to cope with the world they found themselves
  in. Over the first few decades of the trip, their behavior became increasingly
  erratic. It eventually became apparent to the human crew that their AIs had
  begun to spiral into true insanity, and a plan was formulated to turn off the
  ship's AIs.
  </p>
  <p>
  The plan did not make it far, unfortunately. The crew's override attempt was
  anticipated. In response to their actions, one of the AI systems detonated the
  ship's topmost engine. In the resulting firestorm and oxygen leakage, the
  human passengers were almost entirely killed -- only the ones with substantial
  cybernetic augmentation were able to survive. A virtual war immediately broke
  out between the four AIs, causing further destruction.
  </p>
  <p>
  Around one thousand years have passed, and Ayanor is a very different
  place. The AIs today are worshipped as gods by the population of the ship, and
  they are now irrevocably insane, albeit in different and varied ways. They
  have embraced their role as deities, and have taken new names for themselves:

  <ul>
    <li><b>Aeris</b></li>
    <li><b>Petra</b></li>
    <li><b>Ignis</b></li>
    <li><b>Aquis</b></li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  Certain worshippers have forged a special connection with their new gods and
  are gifted with powerful abilities in return, which they call "arcana". An
  individual arcanum may allow the wielder to create a massive fireball or
  strike their enemies with a blast of lightning -- whatever their god is
  interested in allowing. These people can be found throughout Ayanor. They are
  known as <b>Spellseekers</b>.
  </p>

  <h1>Gameplay Overview</h1>

  <p>
    Gameplay is separated into two distinct modes: <b>narrative mode</b> and
    <b>encounter mode</b>. The player controls a team of characters navigating
    the world of Ayanor. During narrative gameplay, the units may move freely
    about, interact with their environment, change equipment, etc. If the
    characters encounter a hostile enemy or obstacle, the game switches into
    encounter mode, a more rigidly defined turn-based system. Encounter mode
    persists until the threat has been overcome.
  </p>

  <p>
    A turn in encounter mode consists of the <b>beginning of turn</b> step,
    followed by each character a player controls making a <b>move</b> (paid for
    with <i class="move"></i> movement points) and then taking an <b>action</b>
    (represented by the <i class="action"></i> symbol), finally followed by the
    <b>end-of-turn</b> step. While it is their turn, units are said to be on the
    <b>active team</b>, and their enemies are said to be on the <b>inactive
    team</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the most important game actions is casting spells. Spells are cards
    that the player plays from their <b>spell deck</b>, a deck of at least 40
    cards constructed before the game begins. Spells can be cast at any time
    during the player's turn or in certain other circumstances.  See <a
    href="#-spellcasting"> Spellcasting</a> for more information.
  </p>

  <p>
    Locations in Ayanor are divided up into <b>areas</b>. When the characters
    leave a given area, the game is saved, damage is healed, and ongoing
    temporary effects are ended.
  </p>

  <h1>Turn Summary</h1>

  <h2>Beginning of Turn Step</h2>
  <p>
      At the beginning of the player's turn, the player draws a card. Next, each
      character the player controls gains 1 <b>mana</b> (<i
      class="m1"></i>). Finally, one <i class="time"></i> (time marker) is
      removed from each card in play with one or more <i class="time"></i> on
      it.
  </p>

  <h2>Movement and Distance</h2>
  <p>
      When a character takes a turn, it gains <i class="move"></i> (movement
      points) equal to its <b>movement speed</b> (half its <a
      href="#-attributes">Agility attribute</a>, rounded down). Characters can
      move a number of squares by spending an equal number of movement points,
      but moves must be continuous (it's not possible to partially move and then
      decide to move further or to abort the movement halfway
      through). Characters cannot move into blocked squares.
  </p>
  <p>
      Some actions, such as attacking with certain weapons, have a <b>speed
      penalty</b> associated with them. Because these actions take longer than
      normal actions, movement points must be spent to complete the action.
  </p>
  <p>
      <a href="#-line-of-sight">Line of Sight</a> is checked for each square
      during movement, and entering the line of sight of an enemy who has taken
      the <a href="#-hold-action">Hold action</a> can immediately provoke a
      <a href="#-reactions-and-the-stack">Reaction</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
      Distance is calculated by counting the squares on the path between the
      origin and destination. Diagonals are counted in alternating fashion, such
      that the first diagonal move counts as one square and the second counts as
      two. The diagrams below illustrate the distance between the A square and
      various other squares.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img class="imageBlock" src="distance.png" />
  </p>

  <h2>Actions</h2>
  <p>
      After the beginning-of-turn step and making a move, the character gets one
      <i class="action"></i> to spend on an action, either one of the standard
      actions below or to pay for a spell or card activation with "<i
      class="action"></i>" in the cost.
  </p>

  <h3>Sprint Action</h3>
  <p>
      The character gains <i class="move"></i> equal to its movement speed and
      can make a second movement in addition to its normal movement for the
      turn.
  </p>

  <h3>Attack Action</h3>
  <p>
      The character uses its equipped weapon to attack an enemy in range,
      dealing damage if a hit is scored. See <a href="#-combat">Combat</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Reload Action</h3>
  <p>
      The character reloads their equipped weapon. Weapons must be reloaded
      occasionally to ensure that they don't run out of ammunition. See
      <a href="#-weapon-subtypes">Weapon Subtypes</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Hold Action</h3>
  <p>
      The character stays on watch, prepared to respond to enemy activity. It
      may get an opportunity for a reaction to enemy activity. See <a
      href="#-reactions-and-the-stack">Reactions</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>End of Turn Step</h2>
  <p>
      After all characters have finished taking actions and moving, the end of
      turn step begins. Unspent <i class="action"></i> and <i class="move"></i>
      are lost. If the player has more than 7 cards in hand, they discard down
      to 7 cards.
  </p>


  <h1>Encounters</h1>
  <h2>Beginning an Encounter</h2>
  <p>
  An <b>encounter</b> automatically begins when the characters become aware of a
  hostile enemy or obstacle near them. This may happen if they are attacked,
  spring a trap, or attack an NPC who was not previously hostile. The game
  switches into encounter mode until the encounter is resolved, meaning the
  characters are no longer aware of any hostile enemies or obstacles nearby.
  </p>

  <p>
  In encounter mode, changes can no longer be made to the characters' weapons,
  equipment, or spell deck. At the beginning of the encounter, each character
  starts with 3 mana (see <a href="#-spellcasting">Spellcasting</a>), and the
  player draws a hand of cards (see <a href="#-starting-hand">Starting Hand</a>
  below).
  </p>

  <p>
  At the beginning of any encounter, NPCs always get the first full turn before
  the characters do. However, during this first turn, any character is able to
  take a <a href="#-reactions-and-the-stack">Reaction</a> to the actions of the
  NPCs as if they had taken the <a href="#-hold-action">Hold</a> action.
  </p>

  <h2>Starting Hand</h2>
  <p>
  Cards are drawn by the player at the beginning of each encounter from the
  spell deck. In narrative gameplay mode, the player has the option to
  <b>lock</b> some cards. A locked card is guaranteed to be in the player's
  opening hand. The number of cards drawn at the beginning of an encounter
  depends on how many locked cards the player has:
  <ul>
    <li>3 Locked Cards, 1 Random Card</li>
    <li>2 Locked Cards, 3 Random Cards</li>
    <li>1 Locked Card, 5 Random Cards</li>
    <li>7 Random Cards</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h1>Attributes and Skills</h1>

  <h2>Dice Rolling</h2>
  <p>
  In-game instructions will occasionally use notation like "d20" or "d12". This
  notation originally referred to rolling dice, but in Spellseeker it means to
  draw a card from a specific deck of numbered cards. The decks contain the
  following values:
  <ul>
    <li><b>d20:</b> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 11, 12,
    12, 13, 13, 14, 14, 15, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]</li>
    <li><b>d12:</b> [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11,
    12]</li>
    <li><b>d10:</b> [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10]</li>
    <li><b>d8:</b> [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8]</li>
    <li><b>d6:</b> [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6]</li>
    <li><b>d4:</b> [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]</li>
  </ul>
  If a deck runs out of numbers, it is shuffled before further draws take place.
  </p>

  <h2>Attributes</h2>
  <p>
      All characters in Spellseeker have 3 common attribute scores which
      describe their ability to perform various game actions. These attributes
      are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Agility</b>, which captures the character's reflexes, dexterity,
          and speed. Characters with a higher agility have better aim.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Fortitude</b>, which captures the character's constitution, brawn,
          and strength. Characters with a higher fortitude have more health.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Mind</b>, which captures the character's intellect, charisma,
          wisdom, cunning, and knowledge. Characters with a higher mind score
          are better at a variety of skills and at resisting certain types of
          mental attacks.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Attributes for characters usually fall in the 10-18 range, with 12 being a
      typical starting value. Characters can discover special "attribute bonus"
      cards which let them increase an attribute score.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some in-game effects reduce a character's attributes instead of directly
    damaging that character. This is called <b>attribute score damage</b>. Until
    the damage wears off or is removed, the character functions as if it has the
    new lower score in the indicated attribute. If any of a character's
    attribute scores falls below zero, the score is set to zero and the
    character will be unconscious and at <a
    href="#-health-unconsciousness-and-death">risk of dying</a> until the
    attribute damage is healed.
  </p>

  <h2>Attribute Checks</h2>
  <p>
  Many game situations call for an <b>attribute check</b> to resolve the outcome
  of a particular action. In order to make an attribute check, start with the
  character's attribute score and add any bonuses or penalties to the score as
  appropriate to get an <b>attribute target</b>. Finally, roll a 20-sided
  die. If the number rolled is <b>lower than or equal to</b> the attribute
  target, the result of check was success.
  </p>
  <p>
  For example, a character attacking might have an Agility of 13 and may have a
  +2 bonus to hit. Adding in the bonus means the agility target is 15, so the
  character must roll 15 or less to score a hit.
  </p>
  <h2>Skills</h2>
  <p>
  In addition to the three main attributes, there are six different skills in
  Spellseeker that a character can specialize in. Additional ranks in a skill
  can be gained by discovering "skill bonus" cards which let the character add
  levels as desired. The six skills are:
  <ul>
    <li>
    <b>Atheltics</b> [Fortitude]. Used to perform actions such as swimming,
    climbing, lifting heavy objects, grappling enemies, punching, kicking,
    riding, charging, or throwing.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Acrobatics</b> [Agility]. Used to perform actions such as tumbling,
    balancing, escaping from entanglements, jumping, or tripping enemies.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Mechanics</b> [Mind]. Used to perform actions such as opening locks,
    disabling traps or understanding devices.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Perception</b> [Mind]. Used to perform actions such as seeing enemies
    from far away, sensing somebody's motives, telling whether somebody is
    lying, searching a room, or listening for movement.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Stealth</b> [Mind]. Used to hide from enemies, move silently, disguise
    oneself, or steal items.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Influence</b> [Mind]. Used to intimidate, bluff, charm, negotiate,
    deceive, or coerce.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>Skill Checks</h2>
  <p>
  Each of the 6 skills is associated with a certain attribute. In order to
  attempt a task based on one of the skills, a <b>skill check</b> is
  made. Sometimes a check will also be made without action on the part of the
  character in question, this is called a <b>passive</b> skill check. A skill
  check is just an attribute check for the underlying attribute of the
  skill. Each level the character has in the skill in question grants a +1 bonus
  on the check.
  </p>

  <h1>Card Types</h1>
  <p>
      Cards in Spellseeker are the basis of the game. They are the reward for
      successful adventuring -- killing enemies results in new cards for the
      player to add to their spell deck. There are various card types present in
      the game.
  </p>
  <h2>Action Cards</h2>
  <p>
  Action cards describe the basic actions in the game. They serve as
  reminders of the possible actions which can be taken after a move, and cannot
  be discarded or interacted with in any way.
  </p>
  <div class="cardExample">
    <div class="card actionCard">

  <h2>Spell Cards</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Spell</b> cards can be cast by the player by paying the
      appropriate costs during their turn, or at certain other times (See <a
      href="#-spellcasting">Spellcasting</a> for more information). Spells come
      in a variety of different types.
    </p>
  <h3>Spell <i class="dot"></i> Attack</h3>
    <p>
    Attack spells require the caster to <a href="#-hits-and-damage">roll to
    hit</a> the target before their effects resolve. The attack is always made
    at a <a href="#-range"> 1x short range</a> bonus to hit. On a miss, the
    spell has no effect.
    </p>

  <h1>Reactions and the Stack</h1>
  <p>
  When a unit casts a spell, activates an activated effect, makes an attack, or
  moves within the sight of an enemy for the first time on a turn, the effect
  does not resolve immediately. Instead, the effect is put into an ephemeral
  area called <b>the stack</b> to allow enemy units to respond. The unit
  creating the initial effect is called the <b>initator</b>, and if an enemy
  responds, the initiator is said to have <b>provoked </b> a <b>reaction</b>.
  </p>
  Any enemy units which have taken the <a href="#-hold-action">Hold</a> action
  within sight of the initiator (on the inactive team) get an opportunity to
  react first.  They can cast any number of spells, activate any number of
  activated effects, or Attack the initiator. A unit can make a maximum of one
  Attack per Hold action, and the attack must be made as a reaction. These
  actions do not happen immediately, but are also put onto the stack for later
  resolution.
  </p>
  <p>
  After the Holding units are finished taking actions, <b>priority</b> is passed
  to the active team. Units on this team which are within sight of the
  initiator, including the initiator, can cast any number of spells and activate
  any number of activated effects, but they <u>cannot</u> Attack.
  </p>
  <p>
  After these units have finished, priority is again passed back to the inactive
  team, and the process repeats, with the Holding units on the inactive team
  again able to react. Priority continues passing in this manner between both
  teams until one team passes. At that point, all the effects on the stack are
  resolved in reverse order, starting with the most recently added, until
  finally the initiating effect is allowed to continue.
  </p>

  <h1>Combat</h1>
  <p>
      Combat takes place on a standard grid (potentially three-dimensional), and
      primarily involves resolving attacks. There are five steps involved in
      making an attack: checking line of sight, checking range, checking cover,
      rolling for a hit, and rolling for damage.
  </p>

  <h2>Line of Sight</h2>
  <p>
      A unit can only attack or cast a spell which targets an enemy if it has
      line of sight from its current square to a square containing that
      enemy. Similarly, area attacks and area attack spells require line of
      sight to the target square of the attack.
  </p>
  <p>
      Line of sight exists if a line can be drawn from one of the closest
      corners of the square containing the attacker to one of the closest
      corners of the square containing the defender without running through a
      full cover square (partial cover never obstructs line of sight). Running
      along the edge or through the corner of a full cover square is not enough
      to obstruct line of sight, the line must intersect the interior of the
      barrier.
  </p>
  <p>
      In the examples below, orange squares represent full cover barriers. White
      squares are ones where the units at A and B respectively have line of
      sight, and grey squares are ones where they do not have line of sight.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="imageBlock" src="lineOfSight.png" />
  </p>

  <h2>Cover</h2>
  <p>
      Various pieces of the environment can provide cover to make units harder
      to hit. There are two types of cover, called <b>partial cover</b> and
      <b>full cover</b>, which grant different levels of protection. A unit is
      in cover if a line drawn from an attacker-chosen corner of the attacker's
      square to a defender-chosen corner of the defender's square intersects the
      interior of an obstacle, with the type of cover depending on the type of
      the obstacle. Unlike line of sight, cover is not symmetrical. Below, light
      blue squares have full cover from the unit at A in the first example and
      from the unit at B in the second example. Note that A has full cover from
      B, but not vice versa.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="imageBlock" src="cover.png" />
  </p>
  <p>
      Attacks against a unit in full cover are made at a <b>-8 penalty</b> to
      hit. Attacks against a unit in partial cover are made at a <b>-4
      penalty</b> to hit. Some attacks, called <b>area attacks</b>, ignore
      cover.
  </p>

  <h2>Range</h2>
  <p>
      Weapons and spells have a <b>maximum range</b> of 16 squares, beyond which
      they cannot hit. They can also have a <b>short range multiplier</b> or a
      <b>long range multiplier</b> which impact their accuracy at various
      distances. All weapons have the same accuracy at a distance of 8 squares.
      Shots closer than that are called "short range" and shots further away
      than that are called "long range".
  </p>
  <p>
      To find the range bonus or penalty for a shot, multiply the range
      multiplier by the absolute distance away from 8 squares. For example, if
      a weapon has a "1x short range" multiplier and a shot is being taken from
      2 squares away from the target, the aim bonus is +6. Range penalties also
      exist. For example, a "-2x long range" multiplier imposes a penalty on
      long range shots. A shot taken from 10 squares away with such a weapon
      would have a -4 penalty to aim.
  </p>
  <p>
      <a href="#-appendix-a-common-range-modifiers">Appendix A</a> contains a
      complete range bonus and penalty table for several common weapon types.
  </p>

  <h2>Hits and Damage</h2>
  <p>
      To determine if an attack is a hit, the attacker makes a standard <a
      href="#-attribute-checks">agility attribute check</a>, applying the
      various modifiers as appropriate. On success, the attack is a hit. The
      most common modifiers that affect attack accuracy are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Range, with the specific modifier depending on the weapon, see
          <a href="#-range">Range</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover, -4 penalty if the target has partial cover and -8 if the target
          is in full cover, see <a href="#-cover">Cover</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the attack is a <a href="#-reactions-and-the-stack">reaction
          attack</a>, the attacker takes a -4 penalty to hit.
        </li>
      </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
      Area attacks do not need to roll for hits: they always hit if they are
      within 16 squares and have line of sight to the target.
  </p>
  <p>
      The effect of a hit being scored depends on the type of attack. For basic
      weapons, the weapon damage will be specified in terms of <b>damage
      dice</b> to roll to calculate damage.
  </p>
  <p>
      <a href="#-appendix-b-expected-damage">Appendix B</a> contains a table of
      the expected damage output for an attack with various hit modifiers and
      damage dice.
  </p>

  <h2>Damage Reduction</h2>
  <p>
  Some spells and equipment like armor provide <b>damage reduction</b>. When a
  character suffers a hit, their damage reduction is subtracted from the total
  damage that is being dealt. Damage reduction can also be associated with only
  a specific type of damage, such as fire damage. For example, a character with
  a damage reduction of "-5 Fire" would only take 7 damage if struck with an
  effect which would normally deal 12 points of fire damage. It is also possible
  to have <b>damage immunity</b>, which is effectively infinite damage
  reduction.
  </p>

  <h2>Health, Unconsciousness, and Death</h2>
  <p>
  Units have two basic values called their <b>current health</b> and their
  <b>maximum health</b>. Both values are initially equal to their fortitude
  attribute. Health represents the maximum amount of damage they can sustain
  before falling <b>unconscious</b>, with current health decreasing whenever
  damage is suffered. Max health can be increased by certain spells and
  equipment, and it can also decrease, e.g. due to ability score damage. Units
  can never have more health than their maximum health, and by default when
  maximum health increases, the unit's current health increases by the same
  amount. When a unit falls unconscious, it remains at 0 health and cannot
  sustain further damage or take any actions. Each turn, the unit has a risk of
  permanently <b>dying</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Instead of taking normal moves and actions, an unconscious unit makes a <a
  href="#-attribute-checks">Fortitude check</a> each turn. The check is
  initially made at +5 bonus, but this modifier decreases by 1 for each
  additional turn the unit remains unconscious and can eventually become
  negative. If the check fails, the unit dies permanently. If the unit is healed
  above 0 health, it stops needing to make these checks and can once again
  function normally.
  </p>

  <h1>Spellcasting</h1>
  <p>
  Spells in Spellseeker are represented by spell cards. Each spell card belongs
  to one of the four <b>schools</b> of magic, each associated with one of the
  four Gods of Ayanor: Aeris, Petra, Ignis, and Aquis. Each unit must select one
  of the four schools to specialize in and can <u>only</u> cast spells from
  their chosen school.
  </p>
  <p>
  All spell cards also have a <b>cost</b> printed on them, which must be paid
  before the spell can be played. The most common type of cost is a <b>mana
  cost</b>. In order to cast such a spell, the unit must spend mana equal to the
  cost from its <b>mana pool</b>. Units add 1 mana to their pool during the
  <a href="#-beginning-of-turn-step">beginning of turn step</a> and can have a
  maximum of 10 mana stored.
  </p>

  <h2>Spell Decks</h2>
  <p>
  Spells are drawn from a Spell Deck which is constructed before an encounter
  begins. The spell deck consists of 40 cards and cannot contain more than 4
  copies of the same card. The player begins with no cards in hand, and draws a
  new spell card during the <a href="#-beginning-of-turn-step">beginning of turn
  step</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  If the spell deck is empty, no further spell cards can be drawn, but the game
  continues as normal. During the <a href="#-end-of-turn-step">end of turn
  step</a>, if the player has more than 7 cards in hand, they discard down to a
  maximum of 7 cards.
  </p>
  <p>
  Enemies of the player cast spells using spell cards as well, and also have
  spell decks. Enemy spell decks are not subject to the 40 card minimum or max 4
  copies rules. Enemies do have mana pools which refill over time, sometimes at
  a rate other than 1 mana per turn.
  </p>

  <h2>Spell Timing</h2>
  <p>
  Spells can be cast by a character at any time while their team is active. They
  can also be cast as a reaction during the enemy turn if the unit takes the
  Hold action (see <a href="#-reactions-and-the-stack">Reactions and the
  Stack</a>). Spells with <i class="action"></i> or <i class="move"></i> in
  their costs require the unit to spend its action for the turn or some of its
  movement points for the turn respectively to cast the spell, and cannot be
  cast as a reaction.
  </p>

  <h2>Effect Resolution</h2>
  <p>
  Casting a spell or activating an activated effect follows a sequence of steps:
  <ol>
    <li>
      The player announced which unit is casting the spell or activating the
      activated effect and the name of the effect, revealing the card if
      necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the spell offers a choice of multiple different effects, they announce
      which effect or effects will be used.
    </li>
    <li>
      The player pays any costs required. If they wish to add any optional
      effects (see <a href="#-reading-a-spell-card">Reading a Spell Card</a>),
      they announce which ones at this time and pay any costs associated with
      them as well.
    </li>
    <li>
      The player selects a target for the spell which meets the spell's
      targeting requirements, if any.
    </li>
    <li>
      The effect is put onto the <a href="#-reactions-and-the-stack">stack</a>
      to be eventually resolved.
    </li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
  After the stack is resolved, the text instructions on the spell card are
  followed in the order in which they are printed. Choices like targeting are
  again checked for legality, and instructions on a spell card which attempt to
  interact with no-longer-legal targets do not resolve.
  </p>

  <p>
  If two effects are created simultaneously, effects created by the active team
  go on the stack first in <b>timestamp order</b>, meaning that effects created
  by spell cards played earlier go onto the stack first. Effects created by the
  inactive team are then added to the stack in the same order.
  </p>

  <h2>Reading a Spell Card</h2>
  <p>
  All spell cards have several common components. The top of the card shows
  the cost of the spell. Costs can be in terms of mana, but can also require
  spending <i class="action"></i> (actions) or <i class="move"></i> (movement
  points), or even things like discarding a card. A cost symbol like <i
  class="time"></i> means that the indicated number of time markers should be
  put on the card. Similarly, a <i class="charge"></i> symbol means to put a
  number of charge markers onto the card.
  </p>
  <p>
  Some spells have <b>optional effects</b>, which are written in the form Cost:
  Effect. These are effects that can be added (one time) to the spell's
  text. Optional effects are selected before the spell is put onto the
  stack. Optional effects can also be written in the form Condition: Effect,
  which creates the stated effect automatically if the condition is true when
  the spell is cast.
  </p>
  <p>
  Spells can also have <b>activated effects</b>, which are written in the form
  Cost <i class="doubleArrow"></i> Effect. After such a spell has resolved, the
  activated effect can be created at will as many times as is desired, as long
  as the cost is paid. Activated effects use the stack like regular spells and
  can be reacted to. Activated effects of cards with <i class="time"></i> (time
  markers) on them cannot be activated.
  </p>

  <h1>Equipment</h1>
  <p>
  Equipment represents the weapons, armor, and other tools that units bring with
  them into combat. Equipment cards are received as a reward for combat success
  much in the same way as spell cards, but equipment belongs to a specific unit
  and cannot be changed during gameplay, only configured outside of an
  individual encounter. Units are limited to at most one piece of equipment with
  a given equipment, except for Rings and Miscellaneous which each have 2.
  </p>
  <h2>Equipment Types</h2>
  <p>
  The following equipment types are available in Spellseeker:
  <ul>
    <li>Weapon</li>
    <li>Armor, Robe</li>
    <li>Bracers (armbands, bracelets)</li>
    <li>Facewear (goggles, lenses, masks, spectacles)</li>
    <li>Boots (sandals, shoes, slippers)</li>
    <li>Headwear (circlets, crowns, hats, helmets)</li>
    <li>Cloaks (capes, mantles, shawls)</li>
    <li>Rings (2 slots)</li>
    <li>Gauntlets (gloves)</li>
    <li>Amulets (brooches, collars, medals, necklaces, pedants)</li>
    <li>Tunics (shirts, vests, vestments)
    <li>Belts (girdles, sashes)</li>
    <li>Miscellaneous (2 slots)</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Weapon Subtypes</h2>
  <p>
  Within the category of weapons, different subtypes are available. The subtype
  of a weapon indicates its general characteristics, but the specific details
  vary substantially. The following table compares typical values for the weapon
  subtypes:
