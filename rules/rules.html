    <b>Spellseeker</b> is a turn-based, squad-oriented tactical combat system
    set in a fantasy-modern world. The player battles mythical creatures and
    ferocious monsters, employing conventional weapons and incredible magical
    spells based on a collectible card system.
  </p>

  <h1>Gameplay Overview</h1>

  <p>
    Gameplay is turn-oriented. The player controls a squad of warriors
    individually referred to as <b>units</b>. A turn consists of the
    <b>beginning of turn</b> step, followed by each unit a player controls
    making a <b>move</b> (paid for with <i class="move"></i> movement points)
    and then taking an <b>action</b> (represented by the <i class="action"></i>
    symbol), finally followed by the <b>end-of-turn</b> step.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the most important game actions is casting spells. Spells are cards
    that the player plays from their <b>spell deck</b>, a deck of at least 50
    cards constructed before the game begins. Spells can be cast at any time on
    a player's turn or in certain other circumstances. See <a
    href="#-spellcasting"> Spellcasting</a> for more information.
  </p>

  <h2>Beginning of Turn Step</h2>
  <p>
      At the beginning of a player's turn, the player draws a card. Next, each
      unit the player controls gains 1 <b>mana</b> (<i
      class="m1"></i>). Finally, one <i class="time"></i> (time marker) is
      removed from each card in play with one or more <i class="time"></i> on
      it.
  </p>

  <h2>Movement and Distance</h2>
  <p>
      All units have a movement speed. When a unit takes a turn, it gains <i
      class="move"></i> (movement points) equal to its movement speed. Units can
      move a number of squares by spending an equal number of movement points,
      but moves must be continouous (it's not possible to partially move and
      then decide to move further or to abort the movement halfway
      through). Units cannot move into blocked squares.
  </p>
  <p>
      Some actions, such as attacking with certain weapons, have a <b>speed
      penalty</b> associated with them. Because these actions take longer than
      normal actions, movement points must be spent to complete the action.
  </p>
  <p>
      <a href="#-line-of-sight">Line of Sight</a> is checked for each square
      during movement, and entering the line of sight of an enemy who has taken
      the <a href="#-hold-action">Hold action</a> can immediately provoke a
      <a href="#-reactions">Reaction</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
      Distance is calculated by counting the squares on the path between the
      origin and destination. Diagonals are counted in alternating fashion, such
      that the first diagonal move counts as one square and the second counts as
      two. The diagrams below illustrate the distance between the A square and
      various other squares.

  </p>

  <h2>Actions</h2>
  <p>
      After the beginning-of-turn step and making a move, the unit gets one <i
      class="action"></i> to spend on an action, either one of the standard
      actions below or to pay for a spell or card activation with "<i
      class="action"></i>" in the cost.
  </p>

  <h3>Sprint Action</h3>
  <p>
      The unit gains <i class="move"></i> equal to its movement speed, which
      it can spend to move. This is in addition to its normal movement for
      the turn.
  </p>

  <h3>Attack Action</h3>
  <p>
      The unit uses its equipped weapon to attack an enemy in range, dealing
      damage if a hit is scored. See <a href="#-combat">Combat</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Reload Action</h3>
  <p>
      The unit reloads their equipped weapon. Weapons must be reloaded
      occasionally to ensure that they don't run out of ammunition. See
      <a href="#-guns">Guns</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Hold Action</h3>
  <p>
      The unit stays on watch, prepared to respond to enemy activity. It may get
      an opportunity for a reaction to enemy activity. See <a
      href="#-reactions">Reactions</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>End of Turn Step</h2>
  <p>
      After all units have finished taking actions and moving, the end of turn
      step begins. Unspent <i class="action"></i> and <i class="move"></i> are
      lost. If the player has more than 5 cards in hand, they discard down to 5
      cards.
  </p>


  <h1>Cards</h1>
  <p>
      Cards in Spellseeker are the basis of the game. They are the reward for
      successful adventuring -- killing enemies results in new cards for the
      player to add to their spell deck. There are various card types present in
      the gamee:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Spell</b> Cards can be cast by the player by paying the
          appropriate costs during their turn, or at certain other times (See <a
          href="#-spellcasting">Spellcasting</a> for more information). Spells
          have two possible subtypes:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Immediate</b> spells are one-time effects. The caster pays
              their costs, the effects resolve, and then the card is discarded.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Ongoing</b> spells stay in play after being resolved,
              continuing to have an impact, instead of being discarded.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Equipment</b> cards represent tools used the units which give them
          special abilities and ongoing effects. See <a href="#-equipment">
          Equipment</a> for more information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Enemy</b> cards represent the various foes the player can encounter
          during the game, describing their abilities and basic statistics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Spellseeker</b> cards represent the different units controlled by
          the player, and also display their basic statistics such as movement
          speed.
        </li>
      </ul>
